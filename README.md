# touchpadhold
A quick and dirty hack to let you tap and hold with your windows laptop touchpad to drag content, select text, etc.
You can compile the code in release to make it run in the background for the feature to be enabled, or in debug mode to get console output of errors.
The application has to run with administrative privilege to be usable with other administrator UI.
